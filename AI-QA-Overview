# ðŸ¤– AI Testing Overview for QA

## What is AI Testing?

AI Testing involves evaluating Machine Learning (ML) models and systems using QA principles to ensure reliability, fairness, and performance.

## Key Concepts for QA in AI

- **Data Validation**: Ensure quality, balance, and representativeness of input data
- **Model Behavior Testing**:
  - Is the model accurate on known scenarios?
  - How does it perform on edge cases?
- **Bias & Fairness**: Identify unintentional discrimination in results
- **Explainability**: Can we explain why a prediction was made?
- **Performance Drift**: Does model performance degrade over time?

## How QA Can Contribute

âœ… Design edge case test scenarios  
âœ… Compare expected vs. actual ML predictions  
âœ… Validate inputs and outputs for consistency  
âœ… Test APIs serving AI results  
âœ… Collaborate with data scientists to build test sets  
âœ… Automate repetitive validations (Python + Pandas + Pytest)
