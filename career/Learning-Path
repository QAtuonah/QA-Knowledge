# 🧭 QA Career Roadmap — Manual QA → Automation → AI Testing

## 🎯 Final Goal:
Become a QA Engineer with strong skills in:
- Manual Testing
- Test Automation (Python + Selenium)
- AI/ML Model Validation & Data Testing

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Learning Path

### 🧪 1. Strengthen Manual QA Foundations
- Review test case writing, exploratory testing, bug reporting
- Learn test management tools (Jira, TestRail, Zephyr)
- Understand software development lifecycle (Agile, Scrum)
- Practice creating test plans, scenarios, and checklists

📘 Resources:
- Guru99 Manual Testing Series
- Ministry of Testing Community
- ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus

---

### ⚙️ 2. Learn Test Automation with Python + Selenium
- Learn Python basics: variables, loops, functions, OOP
- Setup Selenium WebDriver
- Write automated test scripts (locators, waits, assertions)
- Integrate with Pytest and run basic test suites
- Use Page Object Model (POM) for scalable design

- [Google IT Automation with Python (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

🧰 Tools:
- Python, Selenium, Pytest, ChromeDriver, Pycharm

---

### 🗃️ 3. Learn SQL + Data Validation
- Write queries to verify data correctness
- Join multiple tables for test cases
- Validate ETL pipelines or backend services

📘 Free Course:
- [SQL for Data Analysis (Mode)](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)
- [Khan Academy - SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)

---

### 🧠 4. Introduction to AI/ML Concepts
- Understand how ML models work (classification, regression, etc.)
- Learn common issues in AI systems: bias, overfitting, drift
- Know how predictions are served (APIs, model endpoints)

📘 Free Courses:
- [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
- [AI For Everyone – Andrew Ng (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)

---

### 🤖 5. AI Testing & QA for ML Models
- Learn to validate datasets (e.g., missing values, imbalanced classes)
- Build test cases for ML APIs
- Understand model explainability tools
- Use Python + Pandas to explore model inputs/outputs

📘 Recommended Reading:
- [Testing AI Systems – Google](https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/06/testing-ai-systems.html)
- [ML Testing Guide – DeepMind](https://github.com/deepmind/ml-testing-guide)

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Skills to Stand Out
- Git & GitHub for version control
- CI/CD basics (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- REST API testing (Postman, Pytest + requests)
- Basic data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---

## ✅ Suggested Project Ideas
| Project | Skills Applied |
|--------|----------------|
| Automate a login/logout flow | Python, Selenium, POM |
| Write SQL queries for a mock DB | Data validation |
| Build test suite for a fake ML model API | API testing, AI understanding |
| Create GitHub repo to showcase scripts | Portfolio building |

---

## 🧭 Final Tip:
Don’t rush the journey — each layer builds on the previous. Focus on real understanding, not just certificates. Combine practical exercises with study, and document everything in GitHub or Notion.
